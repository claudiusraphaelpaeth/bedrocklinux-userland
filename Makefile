#
# This creates a script which can be used to install or update a Bedrock Linux
# system.
#
# First install the necessary build dependencies:
#
# - Standard UNIX utilities: grep, sed, awk, etc.
# - gcc 4.9.1 or newer
# - git 1.8 or newer
# - meson 0.38 or newer
# - ninja
# - fakeroot
# - make
# - gzip
# - gpg (optional)
#
# Ensure you have internet access (to fetch upstream dependencies), then run:
#
#     make GPGID=<gpg-id-with-which-to-sign>
#
# to build a signed install/update script or
#
#     make SKIPSIGN=true
#
# to build an unsigned install/update script.
#
# This build system attempts to strike a balance between being overly dependent
# on the host system at the expense of portability, and maximizing portability
# at the expense of build time.  Build tools such as gcc and meson are taken
# from the host system rather than recompiled.  Upstream code which ends up
# within the output script is compiled from source.
#
# In order to ensure portability, the code base is compiled against musl.  To
# do so easily, this uses the `musl-gcc` wrapper, which in turn means gcc is
# required.  Effort to support other compilers, such a clang, should be made at
# some point in the future.
#
# Directory layout:
#
# - src/ contains Bedrock's own code, in contrast to upstream libraries.
# - src/slash-bedrock/ contains files and directories which will populate the
#   eventual install's /bedrock/ directory as-is.  Anything from here is copied
#   over preexisting files in an update, and thus this should not contain
#   configuration the user may change.
# - src/default-configs/ contains default configuration files.  These are files
#   which may be used in a fresh install but should not be applied over
#   existing files in an update.
# - src/installer/ contains the actual installer script.  The build system will
#   embed the eventual system files into the installation script.
# - Other src/ directories correspond to source for binary executables.  These
#   binaries will be included in the slash-bedrock structure embedded within
#   the installation script.
# - vendor/ (initially absent) will contain upstream build dependencies.  The
#   build system will automatically fetch these and populate vendor/
#   accordingly.  The build system will attempt to automatically get the latest
#   stable version and may occasionally fail if an upstream component changes
#   too drastically.  This is purposeful, as it will service as a canary
#   indicating developer attention is required and preferable to distributing
#   outdated upstream components which may contain security vulnerabilities.
# - vendor/*/.success_fetching_source files indicate that the given vendor
#   component's files have been successfully acquired.  This is used to
#   properly handle interrupted downloads.
# - build/ (initially absent) will contain intermediate build output which can
#   be safely removed.
# - build/support/ will contain build-time support code and will not directly
#   end up in the resulting install.
# - build/bedrock/ will contain files which eventually end up in the installed
#   system's /bedrock/ directory.  This will be populated by src/slash-bedrock/
#   contents and the various src/ binaries.
# - build/completed/ will contain files which indicate various build steps have
#   been completed.  These are for build steps that may produce many output
#   files as an alternative to verbosely tracking each individual output file.
# - Makefile services as the build system.
# - `*.md` files service as documentation.
#
# Many dependencies have deep paths which may be awkward to type at a command
# line.  For these, shorter aliases are created.
#
# Where possible, recipes which acquire upstream source should attempt to get
# the latest stable version.  This does risk the possibility that an upstream
# change breaks the build system, but this is preferable to acquiring outdated,
# insecure files.  If the build system breaks, someone will be notified, while
# a missed security update may go unnoticed for a while.
#
# To format the code base, install:
#
# - shfmt (https://github.com/mvdan/sh)
# - indent (GNU)
#
# and run
#
#     make format
#
# To run various static analysis tools against the code base, install
#
# - shellcheck
# - cppcheck
# - clang
# - gcc
# - tcc
# - scan-build (usually distributed with clang)
# - shfmt (https://github.com/mvdan/sh)
# - indent (GNU)
# - uthash
# - libfuse3
# - libcap
# - libattr
#
# and run
#
#     make check
